# ADR-0001: Use Axum as HTTP server

> **Status:** accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-30

**References:** [RFC-0001](../rfc/RFC-0001.md)

## Context

We need a HTTP server framework to build our API on.

## Decision

We decided to use `Axum` as incoming http adapter in our hexagonal architecture.

## Consequences

Positive: large communitive, lot of control.
Negative: pretty lowlevel, not best error handling.

## Alternatives Considered

- [x] Use Axum as HTTP server framework
- [ ] Use Actix-web as HTTP server framework
